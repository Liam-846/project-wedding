            <h3>How we met ...if you let Rebekah tell it.</h3>
            <p>Javan faded me. The first time I saw him, I was determined! I was singing in Harmonyx (an a cappella
                group)
                and I heard from a mutual friend that he was also a singer. After I spent about a week building up the
                confidence to ask him to audition he said "I'll think about it" and walked smooth off. When auditions
                finally rolled around and he walked into the room and sang his song *fans self* I knew I got him. And
                I've
                had him ever since.</p>
            <h3>Javan's Version.</h3>
            <p>I walked around with my fellow hooligans as a college sophomore at UNC Fall Fest 2009. The exhibition
                showcased Rebekah's sorority on stage and my whole group just stopped. I told them then and there that
                was
                me so nobody try anything foolish. I found out she sang in an a cappella group so I auditioned so I
                could
                sing behind her. I've been standing behind her ever since...
